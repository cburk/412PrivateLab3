To run this scheduler, use the command schedule.  For example:
./schedule example.ilocFilename.i

The scheduler can be run with two possible arguments.  These are:
schedule -h (Lists these possible arguments)
schedule <filename> (Performs scheduling on the iloc file specified by filename)

It is not necessary to build the code before running it.
